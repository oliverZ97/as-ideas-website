# Axel Springer Tech Journey
For one week I had the honor and privilege to travel together with 22 other members of the Axel Springer Family to Israel. Together with me was one direct colleague, some people from the ASIT and people from all over Axel Springer: BILD, WELT, Axel Springer Spain, Media Impact, Aufeminin, immonet, immowelt, Axel Springer Ringe and Onet. It was awesome.

But let us start with the title of this post: Takhles, Balagan and Chutzpah. These are the three things I learned embody Israel. And I must say I really liked this combination.
* [Takhles](http://blog.extensionengine.com/the-most-important-word-in-hebrew/) = Tachless, speaking directly what you mean. All germans should know this term. But Israelis live it.
* [Balagan](http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/1.535446) = A mess. Like chaos. Like a super complex situation where you can not say what's really going on.
* [Chutzpah](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1586271/jewish/Chutzpah.htm) = It's a kind of a cosmic attitude, as though there's nothing really there stopping you from doing whatever you want. It is pure boldness.

And another think before we start: This is not an article about Israel or their startup culture, but a report about the journey and what we actually did. Keep in mind that it also is my personal view.

## Why travel to Israel?

When Axel Springer started his business over 70 years ago, he wanted to change things, discover new business models and was driven by innovation. During his life he became deeply connect to Israel (he was not jewish) and even more important, to the people there. I can now understand why.

Axel Springer has a long tradition and deep connection to Israel. One of our "Essentials" is: We support the Jewish people and the right of existence of the State of Israel. One of the goals of our journey is to connect us to this foundation of our company.

It's also meant to connect us internally and to our colleagues  in Israel. The members of our group came from all over Europe, with different backgrounds in tech. We at Axel Springer don't want to be a finical found consisting of different companies. But a family. And after six very intense days we really became one.

On the other hand the journey is of course a business trip: We try to learn from Israel about innovation, startup culture, flat hierarchies and technology. There are quite some companies to visit and talk to.

So to sum up our mission: Networking within the Axel Springer Family, visiting our Israeli brothers and sisters, pursue the connection of Axel Springer to Israel, become inspired and learn from all the different companies in Israel. And of course it's meant as a incentive for us.

# Some things I found out while in Israel
> Every one here has an opinion and is always expressing it. There is a saying: Two Israelis, three opinions.

They like to use the horn on the streets, even more than Italians. They also have the best ice cream outside of Italy. Ten years ago in Tel Aviv there was no skyline. Israel is tiny. Like really tiny. Think like Hessen or Sicily. Two thirds of the country are only Sahara desert. They nearly exclusively use Windows PCs. Every Israeli is a salesman selling Israel. You will see a huge amount of electronic bicycles. You will most likely not see any electric car.

One important tip: If you ever go on a business trip to Israel - bring a lot of long clothes. The air conditioning is brutal. And most religious places require long cloth.

You should always take three lessons from any workshop or thing you to. Here are my three about the journey.

First: If you talk about Israel you have no fucking clue.
Second: if we don't join forces between the IT departments we are screwed. 
Third: Europe and especially Germany could learn everything needed about Refugees and Immigration from Israel, the mistakes and the successes.

# Day 1: Startup Nation Israel
Traveling to Israel can be quite an adventure. They normally have their own checkin-in area on the airport with special standing desk for questioning. I was asked a lot of question, quite some private ones and needed to show emails. The israeli security officer left me two times. For my colleague it was even more intense - they searched his whole cabin bag. It took me around 20 minutes to clear the first security, for him it took 40 minutes. And that's not the end: Flights to Israel have their own gates with additional and more rigorous security. So we meet the security offices again before we are able to enter the gate. Fun fact: Israel has two airports, but only one is a international one. It is called Ben Gurion, after the founder of the state.

After landing I learned my first lesson in Israel: Never stand in line on the immigration counter behind arabic people. You will wait ages.

Getting to our hostel proved also quite interesting - the was a strike from the taxi drivers. But only at the airport, and I couldn't understand any explanation offered to me. Only a company name "get" (think mytaxi or ueber) offered their service. For quite a premium price. So we finally arrived on time in the [Abraham Hostel Tel Aviv](https://abrahamhostels.com/tel-aviv/gallery/) and our roommates are chosen randomly. I end up with Lars, a guy from Plug'n Play, the startup accelerator from Axel Springer. We get along quite well. I think we'll even have lunch at sometime in Berlin. 

The evening starts with a short trip with some people who also arrived a little early to get some ice cream. And the ice we find is awesome.

# Day 2: Startups in Tel Aviv
We started the day at 8am in the huge common room of our hostel and took the bus at 9am to the old harbor of Tel Aviv - named Yafo or Jaffa. The harbor is over 4000 years old and is known to be the gate to the holy land. We walked in the very hot sun and through the hummid air towards the newer part of Tel Aviv. We stopped at quite some sites and Samson explained the history of the city. The tour also included the founding house of Israel, where we watched a short movie about the founding of the state. At the end we ate awesome icecreame, which in my opinion was way better than 90% of the icecream elsewhere in the world.

At 12.30 we arrived the second stop of the day - RosenXXX. We ate some sandwiches on the ground level and at 13.00 our meeting with Shahar Tzafrir, one of the six partners from [Magma Ventures](http://www.magmavc.com/), started. The meeting was on the 25th floor and the view was awesome! If you ever visited some countries beyond Europe you may know [Waze](https://www.waze.com/) - the biggest exist of Magma. He told us a lot about the reasons why there are so many startups in Israel and how the operate. Only downside: The room was like

# Day 3: Google, Microsoft and Cybersecurity

Our first host [team8](http://team8.vc) cancelled the appointment in the last second. So the morning started more relaxed than the first one. We meet at 10am and take our bus and visited Google. They occupy 13 floors in a skyscrapper. Our meeting room is on the 34th floor at the [Google Campus Tel Aviv](https://www.campus.co/tel-aviv/en).

# Day 5: Sushi in the Tower of David
The day starts with a trip to [Yad Vashem](http://www.yadvashem.org/), the The World Holocaust Remembrance Center.   We walk through the old city to the newer parts and take the tram. The tour to the museum is like a sightseeing tour on its own.

This museum is still something else. You can walk for some hours through it, outside and inside. It is really extensive. We start with a labyrinth with 5m high walls. On the walls you find the names of every town where jews were deported. Afterwards we enter the inside of the museum. It is for free, but really crowded. We split up and everyone walks on their own through the history of antisemitism until the state of Israel was founded.

When I was younger I visited Buchenwald and Auschwitz and you learn everything about it in school in Germany. But the of huge grade detail in this museum is still depressing. And everything is told in no other way than through personal stories and things left by the dead. You are not allowed to take any pictures and everyone sticks to rule. You actually do not want to take any pictures.

After 90 minutes, which needed me to take some shortcuts, I arrive at the end. It is immense round room with a circular pathway in the middle in around 2 meters height. The room contains the name of over 3 million people. I can't breath anymore and am deeply touched.

The last thing you see in the museum is a platform with a view opening over Jerusalem and the most important memorial of the Holocaust: The founding of the state of Israel.

Time for the Tower of David. It stands on a hill and was originally two levels higher. In past centuries it must have been a sight like seeing the Statue of Liberty for the first time. The lower parts of the citadel are over 2,000 years old.

We meet [Devora Mason](http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/author/devora-mason/), the Manager of the Digital Innovation Lab of the museum. We get a private tour with the rough facts in like 20 minutes. As always on this trip time is too short. We go down into the basement and have a nice sushi lunch. It shows the contrast of Israel: We are sitting surrounded by two-thousand year old stones and eat sushi while hearing Devora talking about innovation and hackathons in the Tower of David.

She introduces the 16 year old Yair Neiger. He is an entrepreneur and started his company [OtheReality](http://www.othereality.com/) by participating in a program from the Tower of David Digital Innovation Lab. He is way better in pitching his idea and company than 2/3 of the Axel Springer Plug'n Play participants on their demo day.  

And the morale of this story: In Israel even a museum in one of the oldest building of humankind is a startup.

We are standing on an open place and Samson tells us about the differ movements of Judaism in Israel. We here fireworks, maybe the end of Ramadan? Two minutes later again some firework. Now we are heading for the West Wall ("Wailing Wall") for the celebration and prayers for Sabbath. The entrance is guarded and we have to pass security with scanners. On the place you see a lot of civil people wearing weapons openly.

As we later learned the fireworks were actually shots. [One police woman was killed by three terrorists](https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article165638905/IS-bekennt-sich-erstmals-zu-Anschlag-in-Israel.html), who were shoot. It was near Damascus Gate, where we walked through some hours ago. It is only 500m away from our guesthouse.

# Day 6: Leaving the Holy Land
The last day. I finally memorised all the names from everybody! And now we need to part. But the journey starts with another extraordinary trip. Together with [Wolfgang Schmidt](http://www.evangelisch-in-jerusalem.org/Gemeinde/gemeinde.php?num=30&kat=30) we take a tour over the rooftops of the houses in the old town. You can see trough some openings and windows to the small walking ways below us. They are full of merchants. Having walked them the past two days and now seeing them from above and how the connect is so cool.

We arrive at the 

I arrive at 9pm in my apartment and I just need sleep. This week was something else.

# The End?
Special thanks to Samson Altman-Schevitz and Karl-Christian Lauk. They both organised this trip and did an awesome job. Samson told us so much about Israel, Jews, the country, the people, the politics. And everything in a very personal manner. Thank you both so much for your hard work to make this journey so special for everyone.

<script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>

I also want to thank our two security guards which were quite impressive, professional and at the same time integrated seamlessly into out group. Even if they couldn't visit Palestine with us. You guys were awesome!

Here are some tips to learn more about Israel and why they rule:  The book [Startup Nation Israel](https://www.amazon.com/Start-up-Nation-Israels-Economic-Miracle/dp/0446541478) which some of us read as preparation of the journey. It was a quite good and easy read and you will learn a lot.
 
This is also this [documentation](http://www.wired.co.uk/video/holy-land-startup-nations-full-documentary) from Wired about it.

Want to see the political conflict from two different views? Try this two videos about the [Israeli side](https://youtu.be/XGYxLWUKwWo) and this one for the [Palestine side](https://youtu.be/QAuBc_cbXo0).
